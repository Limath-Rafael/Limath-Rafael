👋 Hi, I'm @Limath-Rafael

👀 I'm interested in quantitative finance and low-latency software engineering. I want to apply mathematics and engineering to solve practical problems.

🌱 I'm currently studying Pure Mathematics at the University of Porto, in Portugal. Alongside my course, I'm delving into programming, focusing on C++ and C# for the development of low-latency software. I'm currently reading "Calculus by James Stewart - 7th Edition - Volume 1," "C++ High Performance" by Björn Andrist, and "Adaptive Code via C#: Agile coding with design patterns and SOLID principles" by Gary McLean Hall.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that lie at the intersection of mathematics and technology, whether it's developing financial software, optimizing algorithms for low latency, or applying mathematical theories to solve complex problems in the software industry.

📫 To get in touch with me, you can send me a message via WhatsApp: +351 920 539 133. I'm open to discussions about projects and collaboration opportunities.
